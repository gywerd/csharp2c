# C# to Common C
_© 2022 Daniel Giversen_

The foundation is the books __C Programming for Dummies__ (Gookin 2020) and __C Programming Language__ (Kernighan & Ritchie 1988). The goal is to help experienced C# developers transition their experience to C programming.

It is a project in continous development, along the path, that I comprehend the C-languge. This repository will include the relevant 

## Key differences between C# and C
- c has no _string_ keyword - use char instead e.g. `char *stringField`
- no _namespaces_
- not __Object Oriented Programming__ (OOP) oriented 
- no _garbage collection_
- _C_ has pointers, which is considered _unsafe code_ in _C#_

## Common C
Along with the transition, I will develop a minor language library called [_Common C_][1]. The main purpose is to achieve optimized _ahead of time_ compilation. Atm. you need to _build_ the C# code, and then _publish_ it as a _single file application_ to achieve that goal. but _trimming_ does not work well with _.NET_, resulting in bulky file sizes.

Along the way, I might add options for . For now _OOP_ can only be achieved by making libraries with the reused code. Avoid naming variables, functions etc. with identical names as i C#. It is allowed in _C_, but might result in unintended behaviour (read __result in bugs__).

The inspiration will be from _C#_,_C++_, _Objective-C_, _Object Pascal_, Comal80 etc. to even out the differences between _C#_ and _C_.

In a perfect world _c# code_ could be compiled with a _C compiler_, but this is not yet possible. In time _Common C_ might be _THE LANGUAGE to rule them all!_ as well as the favoured programming language for beginners.

## Guide to reading _C for Dummies_
As an experienced C# programmer, the chapters 1-10 can be skimmed/spipped with a few exceptions:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

## Development in Visual Studio
### Previous requirement
- Download and install [_Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition_](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with
	-_Linq to SQL tools_
	- relevant _workloads_
		- _.NET desktop development_
		- _Desktop development with C++_
		- _Mobile development with C++_
		- _Universal Windows Platform_
		- _Mobile Development with C++_
		- _Linux and embedded development with C++_
		- _Data Storage and processing_
- Download source code from [_Common C_ ](https://github.com/gywerd/commonc) and place it in your project

You might not need all workloads at first, but most will be needed for future development.

## Business as usual
I shall not elaborate on using Visual Studio, but _Microsoft_ (MS) has a [tutorial][2]. The objective is how to create a new Common C project:
- set language as _C++_
- set platform as _All platforms_
- set project type as _Console_
- choose _Console App_
- press _Next_

## Intended improvements
- __Common C__ _Nuget-package_ with templates
- _OOP_ and _namespaces_ in _Common C
- Få Net-API'et til at virke
